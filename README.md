# My first repository
### I created a code that records user spending. The main idea of ​​this repository is not to be efficient, but rather as if it were a game to test knowledge in Python
- To be able to use the code you need to have python idl installed on your desktop, I used the most current version (3.12)
- Open the folder path where you saved the repository and click to run `index.py`
In case of running from the command prompt 
 and just open the folder path and write:
```prompt
python index.py
